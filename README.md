CCSE 2019 - Encryption?
===

Introduction
---

* Welcome to a strange CCSE session on encoding, encryption, and programming.
* This session will use python, but does not require much programming experience.
* If you want to use another language, all good :)

Let's go
---

* For new programmers, a python reference is at: [level0.py](level0.py)
* When you are ready to start, head to: [level1.py](level1.py)
* I'm sure you can find where to go after that.

Levels
---

1. ASCII, encodings. Letters into numbers. Numbers into letters.
2. Caesar cipher: words, sentences, encryption, decryption
3. Caeser cipher from a mysterious text file [optional]
4. Hex? Hex vs ascii. Binary? AND, OR, XOR?!
5. XOR encryption: one byte? one line of hex stuff?
6. Unknown, single byte XOR encrypted data [optional]

* If you want to copy the code to make changes and reuse it, make a copy from github here: https://github.com/rifle/ccse2019
* A website that can do lots of encoding/decoding, with simple or complicated combinations of recipes is CyberChef. It's very nifty: https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
